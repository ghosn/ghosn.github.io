This is the Project page of GHOSN (Geo-mapping Hi-Efficiency Over Spatial Nodes) Project, formed as part of the Nissan EV Zero Efficiency Hackathon.  The demo is hosted locally here on Github at ghosn.github.io.

Current navigation systems let drivers choose a route to their destination based on the "fastest" or "shortest" route.  EV drivers trying to maximize their driving range may prefer to drive the "most efficient" route, to ensure that they can make it to their destination (and back).

Navigation providers can calculate theoretical efficiency of various routes using primarily topographical (altitude) data. In contrast, project GHOSN collects and delivers real-world driving efficiency data through data collection in real EVs.

This data can be collected and shared (crowdsourced) in order to benefit all drivers, or it can be collected, stored, and used locally with an individual car. A driver could then choose the most efficient route using the onboard navigation system and data from their own driving habits.

Choosing a route based on efficiency can benefit EV drivers or regular ICE / hybrid drivers as well.
